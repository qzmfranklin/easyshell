        History:

            _ShellBase histories are persistently saved to files, whose name matches
            the prompt string. For example, if the prompt of a subshell is
            '(Foo-Bar-Kar)$ ', the name of its history file is s-Foo-Bar-Kar.
            The history_fname property encodes this algorithm.

            All history files are saved to the the directory whose path is
            self._temp_dir. Subshells use the same temp_dir as their parent
            shells, thus their root shell.

            The history of the parent shell is saved and restored by the parent
            shell, as in launch_subshell(). The history of the subshell is saved
            and restored by the subshell, as in cmdloop().

            When a subshell is started, i.e., when the cmdloop() method of the
            subshell is called, the subshell will try to load its own history
            file, whose file name is determined by the naming convention
            introduced earlier.

        Completer Delimiters:

            Certain characters such as '-' could be part of a command. But by
            default they are considered the delimiters by the readline library,
            which causes completion candidates with those characters to
            malfunction.

            The old completer delimiters are saved before the loop and restored
            after the loop ends. This is to keep the environment clean.
